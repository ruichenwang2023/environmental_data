```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Answers in Tabs {.tabset}

## Load data
```{r echo = FALSE}
require(here)
catrate = read.csv(here("data","catrate.csv"))

head(catrate)
summary(catrate)

```


## Q1
**Q1.**
```{r histogram of the salamander reproduction catastrophic rates.}
hist(catrate$cat.rate, main = "Histogram of Catastrophe Rates", xlab = "Catastrophe Rate", ylab = "Frequency")

```


## Q2-4
**Q2.** p-value = 0.04097
```{r Check for Normality}
shapiro.test(catrate$cat.rate)

```
**Q3.** The null hypothesis for the Shapiro-Wilk test is: “The data were sampled from a normally-distributed population”.

**Q4.** The p-value is less than 0.05, thus the null hypothesis is rejected. The sample care from a non-normally-distributed population. 

**Other Normality Tests**
```{r}
require("nortest")
ad.test(catrate$cat.rate)
lillie.test(catrate$cat.rate)
```


## Q5-7
**Q5.** 
```{r two tailed Student t test}
t.test(catrate$cat.rate, mu = 2/7)

```
**Q6.** The null hypothesis is: “The mean catastrophe rate we observed is equal to 2/7, the observed late-filling rate”.

**Q7.** This is a two tailed t test.

## Q8-10
**Q8.** p-value = 0.01193. There is about 1% probability that the actual mean catastrophe rate equals to 2/7 but we conclude it is not. 

**Q9.** 95% confidence interval is from 0.3526250 to 0.7261295, it did not include zero.

**Q10.** Since we had a small p-value (<0.05) and that the confidence interval did not include zero, we conclude that there was strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. 


```{r one-sided studnet t test}
# One-sided Alternative Hypothesis
t.test(catrate$cat.rate, mu = 2/7, alternative = "greater")

```


## Q11-13
**Q11.**
```{r The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test}
wilcox.test(catrate$cat.rate, mu = 2/7)
```
**Q12.** Wilcoxon test p-value = 0.006275; Student's t test p-value = 0.01193
     Wilcoxon test's p-value is smaller than studetn's t-test.
     
**Q13.** There was strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis, because the p-value 0.006275 was much smaller than 0.05. 

## Q14-15
**Q14.** The conclusions are the same that there was strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the mean is the same as expected value 2/7.

**Q15.** I think Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test was more appropriate for these data because the data is from a small sample (13 observations) and not normally distributed


## Penguin Data Exploration
```{r Comparing two sample means, echo = FALSE}
require(palmerpenguins)
penguin_dat = droplevels(subset(penguins, species != "Gentoo"))

#step 1: Numerical/Graphical Exploration
summary(penguin_dat)
boxplot(
  flipper_length_mm ~ species,
  data = penguin_dat,
  ylab = "Flipper Length (mm)"
)

```

## Q16-17
**Q16**

```{r Step 2 Normality test}
dat_adelie = subset(penguin_dat, species =="Adelie") # Extract the Adelie penguin data
shapiro.test(dat_adelie$flipper_length_mm) # test normality for flipper length

dat_chinstrap = subset(penguin_dat, species == "Chinstrap")
shapiro.test(dat_chinstrap$flipper_length_mm)


```
**Q17.** The p-values are both larger than 0.05, one is 0.72 and the other is 0.8106, so we could not reject that the two distribution are normal. 

## Q18
**Q18**

```{r }
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(dat_adelie$flipper_length_mm,main = "Adelie", xlab = "Flipper Length (mm)")
hist(dat_chinstrap$flipper_length_mm, main = "Chinstrap", xlab = "Flipper Length (mm)")
```


## Q19-20
**Q19.** Alternative hypothesis: the Adelie penguins' flipper lengths are different from Chinstrap penguins'. This is a two tailed test.

**Q20.**
```{r conducting 2 sample t test}
t.test(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguin_dat)
```
